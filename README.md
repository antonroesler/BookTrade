# BookTrade

A Spring MVC web application. The application is nothing more than a prototype. It contains a custom build database that stores infomration about users in text files, as well as a custom build session handler. The session handler does not use cookies. The session ids are passed as pathvariables. 

## What is it for
The Web app is a platform where users can search for books by using the google book api. Users then can put a book on a 'I have' or 'I want' list. A user can search for other users that have a book that this user wants. The user can than make an inquiry and the users can exchange those books in real life.

## Why

People tend to have a ton of books in their shelves that they are likely to nerver touch again. But since the value of a used book is quit low most people are not making the effort to sell these book online. My platform can be the solution to that. The idea is that people can not exchange book for money but books for books. 
By exchanging books instead of buying new ones thousands of trees and tons of co2 can be saved every year.
